# Exercise: Median Earnings in Onondaga County, by Block Group

### Summary

This exercise zooms in on Onondaga county and maps median income
by block group. It builds on the exercise mapping earnings by county.

### Input Data

There are two input files: **onondga_bg.zip**, a shapefile of block group
boundaries for Onondaga county, and **earn_by_bg.csv**, a file containing 
median earnings by block group for Onondaga County.

### Deliverables

There are two deliverables similar to the previous exercise: (1) a QGIS 
project file called **earn_by_bg.gqz**; and (2) a PNG file called 
**earn_by_bg.png** that will be a heat map of median earnings. 

### Instructions

1. Build a heat map for median earnings using five quantiles and the spectral 
color ramp. Save both the project file and a PNG image in the GitHub directory 
using `earn_by_bg.gqz` and `earn_by_bg.csv` as the file names.
